# Intro to Axios
    - Axios can be downloaded as a node_module, or retrieved through a CDN
    - A CDN, or Content Deliver Network, is loaded into your application through a script tag on your html page.
        - The axios CDN can be found on cdnjs.com's website: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/axios
        
    - Axios is a promise based HTTP client.
    - Meaning it allows us to make HTTP requests, and the handling of those requests and the subsequent responses on the front end is handled with promises.

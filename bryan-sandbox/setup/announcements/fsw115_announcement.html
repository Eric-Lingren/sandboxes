API's API's, API's Everywhere! üñ•Ô∏è

<p>Are you ready to learn how computers transfer data?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's have a great time together taking your Javascript and HTML skills to the next level through API integrations!&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the end of this 8-week course, you will have a solid understanding of how API's work, how data is transferred around the web, and how to plug into data to utilize it within your own applications! I'm excited to help lead you on this journey, and I hope you're excited too!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should already be in the class Slack channel.&nbsp; Please pay attention to this since it is my preferred method of communication.&nbsp; Send me a canvas message if you are having any problems with Slack.</p>
<p>See you on Tuesday!&nbsp;</p>
